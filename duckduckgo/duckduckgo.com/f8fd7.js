information technology, a Uniform Resource Identifier is a string of characters used to identify a resource. Such identification enables interaction with representations of the resource over a network, typically the World Wide Web, using specific protocols. Schemes specifying a concrete syntax and associated protocols define each URI. The most common form of URI is the Uniform Resource Locator, frequently referred to informally as a web address. More rarely seen in usage is the Uniform Resource Name, which was designed to complement URLs by providing a mechanism for the identification of resources in particular namespaces.","Abstract":"In information technology, a Uniform Resource Identifier is a string of characters used to identify a resource.
